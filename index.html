	<p>I am an MS (GIS) student at Clark University, Worcester, MA with proven skills in ArcGIS suite (ArcGIS, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise), TerrSet/IDRISI, QGIS, ERDAS Imagine, ENVI, eCognition Developer, C, Python, R, Google Earth Engine, AutoCAD, and STAAD Pro, etc. With a degree in Civil Engineering and successful completion of twelve different projects, I have varied experiences in the applications of remote sensing and GIS, such as estimation of impervious areas in an urban environment using hyperspectral remote sensing in India to impact assessment of a crude oil pipeline between Uganda and Tanzania. During my summer internship at Harvard, I worked on multiple projects including those of NASA and the National Geographic. My current research at Clark Labs involves sensitivity analysis in land change modeler and development of a global land cover change predictor for 2050.
